# SLICC - Extended Kalman Filter
The goal of this SLICC project is to generate an Extended Kalman Filter for the Edinburgh University Formula Student AI team. We want to replace our current third party state estimation software to estimate velocity for car. The three prototypes within this repo show our progress throughout the project as we began to learn more about the EKF and the wider EUFS system. We hope to continue to develop our prototypes for the competition this year.

Each folder contains the code and a guide on how to run the code on a linux operating system.
